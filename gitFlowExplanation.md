# GitFlow
<p>Use of the <strong>GitFlow</strong> model, created by Vincent Driessen, utilizes a technique for organizing the collaboration of a repository. The diagram below shows how to 
organize work in the repository with respect to the feature branches, develop branch, release branches, hotfixes and the master branch. This separates the different type of updates 
on a repository based on the priority of its update.
