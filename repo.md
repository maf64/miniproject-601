A **repository** is the central file storage location used by developers to keep track of all updates of the same file.
A similar model to that of a tree, the **repository** contains branches built off of a main trunk in which different updates to the main application are stored on the different branches.

Refer to [Tech Terms](https://techterms.com/definition/repository) for a complete description of a repository.
