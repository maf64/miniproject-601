To create a **fork** means to generate a personal copy of another person's repository. By using a **fork** when collaborating on a repository, team members are able to work asynchronously to create edits and contributions. While similar to a *clone* which downloads the repository to a user's computer, the **fork** is an entire new copy that is available on the user's GitHub account.
