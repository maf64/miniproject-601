Background
The web development techniques we utilize in this course are found as industry best practices for ensuring maximum productivity and creating competition in the private sector. The use of *Git*, *Docker*, *Automated Testing* and *Continuous Integration* gives organizations the opportunity to update their content quicker and more cost-effectively.

Git
Even for developers with little to no coding experience, **Git** provides a user-friendly way to contribute commits and push requests to a central repository. From an administrative perspective, this saves employers money and time on training developers.

Docker
Even though application development can be written in different languages over various operating systems, **Docker** acts as a central source to streamline the source code. Just like **Git**, **Docker** gives organizations independence to complete intricate coding tasks in limited time.

Continuous Integration
With organizations hiring any number of web developers to collaborate on a project, the use of **Continious Integration** allows the developers to automate updates back to the repository, which saves time on sorting through various updates.

Automated Testing
Another method of redistributing time during web development is through **Automated Testing**. While this method is not the only way for developers to test their applications, this is a convenient strategy for finding the "bugs" in a software application, while developers spend more time addressing and fixing the problems.
