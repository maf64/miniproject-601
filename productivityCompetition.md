## **Background**
<p>The web development techniques we utilize in this course are found as industry best practices for ensuring maximum productivity and creating competition in the private sector. 
The use of <em>Git, Docker, Automated Testing</em> and <em>Continuous Integration</em> gives organizations the opportunity to update their content quicker and more cost-effectively.</p>

## Git
<p>Even for developers with little to no coding experience, <strong>Git</strong> provides a user-friendly way to contribute commits and push requests to a central repository. From an administrative perspective,
this saves employers money and time on training developers.</p>

## Docker
<p>Even though application development can be written in different languages over various operating systems, <strong>Docker</strong> acts as a central source to streamline the source code. Just like <strong>Git, Docker</strong> gives organizations 
independence to complete intricate coding tasks in limited time.</p>

## Continuous Integration 
<p>With organizations hiring any number of web developers to collaborate on a project, the use of <strong>Continious Integration</strong> allows the developers to automate updates back to the repository, which saves time on sorting through various updates.</p>

## Automated Testing
<p>Another method of redistributing time during web development is through <strong>Automated Testing.</strong> While this method is not the only way for developers to test their applications,
this is a convenient strategy for finding the "bugs" in a software application, while developers spend more time addressing and fixing the problems.
